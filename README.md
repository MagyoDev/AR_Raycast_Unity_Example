# AR with Raycast Example in Unity: Overlay Virtual Objects on the Real World

This repository contains an example of Augmented Reality (AR) using Raycast in Unity. With this example, you can overlay virtual objects onto the real world by leveraging real-time camera capture and surface detection through Raycast. The realistic object positioning provides an immersive experience. The example is highly customizable, supporting 3D elements and interactive gestures.

This project serves as a solid foundation for developing complex AR applications, offering a seamless integration between the virtual and real world.
